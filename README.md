**Hubleto** is a community project, a series of repositories resulting in an opensource ERP/CRM package (this `hubleto/erp` repository).

The other underlying repositories are:

  * `hubleto/framework` - PHP-based low level MVC framework
  * `hubleto/react-ui` - React-based UI using other libraries like `primereact` but modified and tailored for Hubleto ERP
  * `hubleto/terminal` - a simple command-line tool for PHP
  * `hubleto/apps` - set of freely available apps covering features like CRM, supply-chain or project management
  * `hubleto/main` - package combining everything together into a Hubleto ERP solution.

`hubleto/erp` (this repository) is a package for `composer create-project` command which installs the `hubleto/main` and adds some other files for easier customization after installation.

**Hubleto is free also for your commercial projects.**

## How to customize

If you want to customize your Hubleto installation, start by creating your new Hubleto app.

```php hubleto create app MyFirstApp```
